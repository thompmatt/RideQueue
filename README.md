# Ride Queue
This program controls and represents any line of a ride at a theme park, implementing the QueueADT and a LinkedList data structure. The groups of people are represented as nodes in the LinkedList. With this project, I further improved my knowledge on queues, and practiced the LinkedList data structure.

This was a project for the CS 300: Programming II course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, taught by Prof. Laura Legault.
